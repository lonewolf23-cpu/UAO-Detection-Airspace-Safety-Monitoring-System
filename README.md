# ✈️ UAO Detection – Airspace Safety Monitoring System

## 📌 Project Overview

The UAO Detection – Airspace Safety Monitoring System is an AI-based Early Warning and Decision Support System designed to detect unidentified aerial objects (UAOs) such as drones, aircraft or unknown flying entities within monitored airspace.

The system performs spatial trajectory prediction, behavioural classification and restricted airspace violation analysis to generate safety-based risk alerts and recommend non-engagement monitoring actions.

This project focuses on enhancing aerial safety monitoring through intelligent detection, predictive analytics and risk assessment.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect unidentified aerial objects (UAOs)
- Classify aerial movement behaviour
- Predict trajectory using 3D spatial coordinates
- Detect restricted airspace violations
- Assess safety risk levels
- Issue early warning alerts
- Recommend non-engagement safety actions

---

## ⚙️ System Modules

### 🔍 Detection Module
Detects aerial objects such as:

- Drone
- Aircraft
- Unknown Object
- Unidentified Object
- Bird
- Flock of Birds

Biological aerial objects such as birds are classified as Non-Threat to reduce false positive alerts.

---

### 📈 Trajectory Prediction Module
Predicts movement of detected aerial objects using:

- Horizontal displacement (x, y)
- Altitude variation (z)

Provides 3D spatial path prediction for safety monitoring.

---

### ⚠️ Restricted Airspace Monitoring
Checks if the predicted path of aerial objects may violate restricted airspace zones.

---

### 📊 Risk Assessment Module
Classifies aerial objects into safety risk levels:

- LOW RISK
- MEDIUM RISK
- POTENTIAL RISK
- HIGH RISK

Based on:

- Movement speed
- Altitude variation
- Restricted airspace violation
- Sudden speed changes

---

### 🚨 Alert & Recommendation Module
Generates safety-based non-engagement actions such as:

- Monitor Continuously
- Restrict Airspace
- Increase Surveillance
- Notify Authority
- Activate Surveillance
- Evacuate Zone
- Notify Medical Assistance
